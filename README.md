# The Effect of School Disruptions on Labor Supply
### 14.32 (Econometric Data Science) Capstone Project

This repository contains the Stata .do files I used to analyze the effect of school disruptions on parental labor supply.

The relevant datasets are:
* Oxford University's [Coronavirus Government Response Tracker](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/coronavirus-government-response-tracker);
* the US Bureau of Labor Statistics' [Current Population Survey](https://www.bls.gov/cps), from January to October 2020; and
* the US Census Bureau's [Household Pulse Survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/household-pulse-survey.html), from August 19 to November 23, 2020 ("weeks" 13 to 19).

The report for this project can be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/f8q8yj7fau5zp07/report.pdf?dl=0).
